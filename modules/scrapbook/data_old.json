Students explore the definition of human rights and the challenges in determining what is right for everyone. The class works together to create a declaration of rights and reflect on the potential reasons why rights can sometimes not transfer from paper to reality. Students examine how rights can help people and wider society and compare the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the list they created. The lesson concludes with students reflecting on the responsibility we all have to ensure our own everyday actions reflect human rights.",

Students begin the lesson by participating in an activity adapted from the Harvard Implicit Bias experiment, revealing the biases students hold about gender and different fields of study. After exploring the causes and consequences of bias, students reflect on ways the portrayal of groups in media shapes our bias and the way we treat others, even when those portrayals do not accurately reflect reality. Students end the lesson by identifying strategies that will help them identify and challenge their biases.",

Students begin the lesson by participating in an activity adapted from the Harvard Implicit Bias experiment, revealing the biases students hold about gender and different fields of study. After exploring the causes and consequences of bias, students reflect on ways the portrayal of groups in media shapes our bias and the way we treat others, even when those portrayals do not accurately reflect reality. Students end the lesson by identifying strategies that will help them identify and challenge their biases.",

Students begin the lesson by participating in an activity adapted from the Harvard Implicit Bias experiment, revealing the biases students hold about gender and different fields of study. After exploring the causes and consequences of bias, students reflect on ways the portrayal of groups in media shapes our bias and the way we treat others, even when those portrayals do not accurately reflect reality. Students end the lesson by identifying strategies that will help them identify and challenge their biases.",

Students explore the definition of human rights and the challenges in determining what is right for everyone. The class works together to create a declaration of rights and reflect on the potential reasons why rights can sometimes not transfer from paper to reality. Students examine how rights can help people and wider society and compare the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the list they created. The lesson concludes with students reflecting on the responsibility we all have to ensure our own everyday actions reflect human rights.",

Students begin the lesson by participating in an activity adapted from the Harvard Implicit Bias experiment, revealing the biases students hold about gender and different fields of study. After exploring the causes and consequences of bias, students reflect on ways the portrayal of groups in media shapes our bias and the way we treat others, even when those portrayals do not accurately reflect reality. Students end the lesson by identifying strategies that will help them identify and challenge their biases.",

Students explore the definition of human rights and the challenges in determining what is right for everyone. The class works together to create a declaration of rights and reflect on the potential reasons why rights can sometimes not transfer from paper to reality. Students examine how rights can help people and wider society and compare the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the list they created. The lesson concludes with students reflecting on the responsibility we all have to ensure our own everyday actions reflect human rights.",

Students begin the lesson by participating in an activity adapted from the Harvard Implicit Bias experiment, revealing the biases students hold about gender and different fields of study. After exploring the causes and consequences of bias, students reflect on ways the portrayal of groups in media shapes our bias and the way we treat others, even when those portrayals do not accurately reflect reality. Students end the lesson by identifying strategies that will help them identify and challenge their biases.",

After exploring the causes and consequences of bias, students reflect on ways the portrayal of groups in media shapes our bias and the way we treat others, even when those portrayals do not accurately reflect reality.

Students begin the lesson by participating in an activity adapted from the Harvard Implicit Bias experiment, revealing the biases students hold about gender and different fields of study. After exploring the causes and consequences of bias, students reflect on ways the portrayal of groups in media shapes our bias and the way we treat others, even when those portrayals do not accurately reflect reality. Students end the lesson by identifying strategies that will help them identify and challenge their biases.",

After exploring the causes and consequences of bias, students reflect on ways the portrayal of groups in media shapes our bias and the way we treat others, even when those portrayals do not accurately reflect reality.

Students begin the lesson by participating in an activity adapted from the Harvard Implicit Bias experiment, revealing the biases students hold about gender and different fields of study. After exploring the causes and consequences of bias, students reflect on ways the portrayal of groups in media shapes our bias and the way we treat others, even when those portrayals do not accurately reflect reality. Students end the lesson by identifying strategies that will help them identify and challenge their biases.",

Students begin the lesson by participating in an activity adapted from the Harvard Implicit Bias experiment, revealing the biases students hold about gender and different fields of study. After exploring the causes and consequences of bias, students reflect on ways the portrayal of groups in media shapes our bias and the way we treat others, even when those portrayals do not accurately reflect reality. Students end the lesson by identifying strategies that will help them identify and challenge their biases.",

         "summary":"In this lesson, students understand how human rights can help society. They begin the lesson identifying the difference between things people want and deserve. Students explore the definition of human rights and the challenges in determining what is right for everyone. The class works together to create a declaration of rights and reflect on the potential reasons why rights can sometimes not transfer from paper to reality. Students examine how rights can help people and wider society and compare the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the list they created. The lesson concludes with students reflecting on the responsibility we all have to ensure our own everyday actions reflect human rights.",

Students begin the lesson by participating in an activity adapted from the Harvard Implicit Bias experiment, revealing the biases students hold about gender and different fields of study. After exploring the causes and consequences of bias, students reflect on ways the portrayal of groups in media shapes our bias and the way we treat others, even when those portrayals do not accurately reflect reality. Students end the lesson by identifying strategies that will help them identify and challenge their biases.",

Students begin the lesson by participating in an activity adapted from the Harvard Implicit Bias experiment, revealing the biases students hold about gender and different fields of study. After exploring the causes and consequences of bias, students reflect on ways the portrayal of groups in media shapes our bias and the way we treat others, even when those portrayals do not accurately reflect reality. Students end the lesson by identifying strategies that will help them identify and challenge their biases.",

Students explore the definition of human rights and the challenges in determining what is right for everyone. The class works together to create a declaration of rights and reflect on the potential reasons why rights can sometimes not transfer from paper to reality. Students examine how rights can help people and wider society and compare the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the list they created. The lesson concludes with students reflecting on the responsibility we all have to ensure our own everyday actions reflect human rights.",

Students begin the lesson by participating in an activity adapted from the Harvard Implicit Bias experiment, revealing the biases students hold about gender and different fields of study. After exploring the causes and consequences of bias, students reflect on ways the portrayal of groups in media shapes our bias and the way we treat others, even when those portrayals do not accurately reflect reality. Students end the lesson by identifying strategies that will help them identify and challenge their biases.",

Students begin the lesson by participating in an activity adapted from the Harvard Implicit Bias experiment, revealing the biases students hold about gender and different fields of study. After exploring the causes and consequences of bias, students reflect on ways the portrayal of groups in media shapes our bias and the way we treat others, even when those portrayals do not accurately reflect reality. Students end the lesson by identifying strategies that will help them identify and challenge their biases.",

Students examine how rights can help people and wider society and compare the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the list they created.

Students begin the lesson by participating in an activity adapted from the Harvard Implicit Bias experiment, revealing the biases students hold about gender and different fields of study. After exploring the causes and consequences of bias, students reflect on ways the portrayal of groups in media shapes our bias and the way we treat others, even when those portrayals do not accurately reflect reality. Students end the lesson by identifying strategies that will help them identify and challenge their biases.",

Students explore the definition of human rights and the challenges in determining what is right for everyone. The class works together to create a declaration of rights and reflect on the potential reasons why rights can sometimes not transfer from paper to reality. Students examine how rights can help people and wider society and compare the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the list they created. The lesson concludes with students reflecting on the responsibility we all have to ensure our own everyday actions reflect human rights.",

Students examine how rights can help people and wider society and compare the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the list they created.

Students explore the definition of human rights and the challenges in determining what is right for everyone. The class works together to create a declaration of rights and reflect on the potential reasons why rights can sometimes not transfer from paper to reality. Students examine how rights can help people and wider society and compare the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the list they created. The lesson concludes with students reflecting on the responsibility we all have to ensure our own everyday actions reflect human rights.",

Students begin the lesson by participating in an activity adapted from the Harvard Implicit Bias experiment, revealing the biases students hold about gender and different fields of study. After exploring the causes and consequences of bias, students reflect on ways the portrayal of groups in media shapes our bias and the way we treat others, even when those portrayals do not accurately reflect reality. Students end the lesson by identifying strategies that will help them identify and challenge their biases.",

After exploring the causes and consequences of bias, students reflect on ways the portrayal of groups in media shapes our bias and the way we treat others, even when those portrayals do not accurately reflect reality. Students end the lesson by identifying strategies that will help them identify and challenge their biases.",

Students explore the definition of human rights and the challenges in determining what is right for everyone. The class works together to create a declaration of rights and reflect on the potential reasons why rights can sometimes not transfer from paper to reality. Students examine how rights can help people and wider society and compare the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the list they created. The lesson concludes with students reflecting on the responsibility we all have to ensure our own everyday actions reflect human rights.",

After exploring the causes and consequences of bias, students reflect on ways the portrayal of groups in media shapes our bias and the way we treat others, even when those portrayals do not accurately reflect reality.

Students explore the definition of human rights and the challenges in determining what is right for everyone. The class works together to create a declaration of rights and reflect on the potential reasons why rights can sometimes not transfer from paper to reality. Students examine how rights can help people and wider society and compare the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the list they created. The lesson concludes with students reflecting on the responsibility we all have to ensure our own everyday actions reflect human rights.",

After exploring the causes and consequences of bias, students reflect on ways the portrayal of groups in media shapes our bias and the way we treat others, even when those portrayals do not accurately reflect reality.

Students explore the definition of human rights and the challenges in determining what is right for everyone. The class works together to create a declaration of rights and reflect on the potential reasons why rights can sometimes not transfer from paper to reality. Students examine how rights can help people and wider society and compare the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the list they created. The lesson concludes with students reflecting on the responsibility we all have to ensure our own everyday actions reflect human rights.",

Students explore the definition of human rights and the challenges in determining what is right for everyone.

Students examine how rights can help people and wider society and compare the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the list they created.

Students begin the lesson by participating in an activity adapted from the Harvard Implicit Bias experiment, revealing the biases students hold about gender and different fields of study. After exploring the causes and consequences of bias, students reflect on ways the portrayal of groups in media shapes our bias and the way we treat others, even when those portrayals do not accurately reflect reality. Students end the lesson by identifying strategies that will help them identify and challenge their biases.",

Students begin the lesson by participating in an activity adapted from the Harvard Implicit Bias experiment, revealing the biases students hold about gender and different fields of study. After exploring the causes and consequences of bias, students reflect on ways the portrayal of groups in media shapes our bias and the way we treat others, even when those portrayals do not accurately reflect reality. Students end the lesson by identifying strategies that will help them identify and challenge their biases.",

After exploring the causes and consequences of bias, students reflect on ways the portrayal of groups in media shapes our bias and the way we treat others, even when those portrayals do not accurately reflect reality.

Using everyday objects, students discover that categories are constructs that serve to help the mind process information. Students then explore the impact social categories have had when used to group people, and identify strategies to mitigate the human tendency to judge people based on the categories.",

Students examine how rights can help people and wider society and compare the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the list they created.

After exploring the causes and consequences of bias, students reflect on ways the portrayal of groups in media shapes our bias and the way we treat others, even when those portrayals do not accurately reflect reality.

Students explore the definition of human rights and the challenges in determining what is right for everyone. The class works together to create a declaration of rights and reflect on the potential reasons why rights can sometimes not transfer from paper to reality. Students examine how rights can help people and wider society and compare the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the list they created. The lesson concludes with students reflecting on the responsibility we all have to ensure our own everyday actions reflect human rights.",

Students begin the lesson by participating in an activity adapted from the Harvard Implicit Bias experiment, revealing the biases students hold about gender and different fields of study. After exploring the causes and consequences of bias, students reflect on ways the portrayal of groups in media shapes our bias and the way we treat others, even when those portrayals do not accurately reflect reality. Students end the lesson by identifying strategies that will help them identify and challenge their biases.",

Students explore the definition of human rights and the challenges in determining what is right for everyone. The class works together to create a declaration of rights and reflect on the potential reasons why rights can sometimes not transfer from paper to reality. Students examine how rights can help people and wider society and compare the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the list they created. The lesson concludes with students reflecting on the responsibility we all have to ensure our own everyday actions reflect human rights.",

Students begin the lesson by participating in an activity adapted from the Harvard Implicit Bias experiment, revealing the biases students hold about gender and different fields of study. After exploring the causes and consequences of bias, students reflect on ways the portrayal of groups in media shapes our bias and the way we treat others, even when those portrayals do not accurately reflect reality. Students end the lesson by identifying strategies that will help them identify and challenge their biases.",

After exploring the causes and consequences of bias, students reflect on ways the portrayal of groups in media shapes our bias and the way we treat others, even when those portrayals do not accurately reflect reality.

Students begin the lesson by participating in an activity adapted from the Harvard Implicit Bias experiment, revealing the biases students hold about gender and different fields of study. After exploring the causes and consequences of bias, students reflect on ways the portrayal of groups in media shapes our bias and the way we treat others, even when those portrayals do not accurately reflect reality. Students end the lesson by identifying strategies that will help them identify and challenge their biases.",

Students end the lesson by identifying strategies that will help them identify and challenge their biases.",

Students examine how rights can help people and wider society and compare the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the list they created. The lesson concludes with students reflecting on the responsibility we all have to ensure our own everyday actions reflect human rights.",
