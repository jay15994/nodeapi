The class works together to create a declaration of rights and reflect on the potential reasons why rights can sometimes not transfer from paper to reality. Students examine how rights can help people and wider society and compare the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the list they created. The lesson concludes with students reflecting on the responsibility we all have to ensure our own everyday actions reflect human rights.",

Students explore the definition of human rights and the challenges in determining what is right for everyone. The class works together to create a declaration of rights and reflect on the potential reasons why rights can sometimes not transfer from paper to reality. Students examine how rights can help people and wider society and compare the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the list they created. The lesson concludes with students reflecting on the responsibility we all have to ensure our own everyday actions reflect human rights.",

      "summary": "In this lesson, students understand how human rights can help society. They begin the lesson identifying the difference between things people want and deserve. Students explore the definition of human rights and the challenges in determining what is right for everyone. The class works together to create a declaration of rights and reflect on the potential reasons why rights can sometimes not transfer from paper to reality. Students examine how rights can help people and wider society and compare the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the list they created. The lesson concludes with students reflecting on the responsibility we all have to ensure our own everyday actions reflect human rights.",
